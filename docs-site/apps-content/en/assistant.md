# Assistant

Assistant is a personal AI workspace for writing, explaining, planning, and
working with supported files. Chats belong to the current user and remain
available when the work continues later.

## Use Assistant

- Start a chat from a suggested task or write your own request. Before the first
  message, optionally choose a Project below the composer to use its shared
  context.
- Attach source files or Cloud resources when the answer must use material
  beyond the message. Files and screenshots can also be pasted directly into
  the composer. A long plain-text paste becomes a durable **Pasted text** attachment;
  **Show in text field** moves a bounded text attachment back into the draft.
  Up to 16 attachments remain in one horizontally scrollable row.
- Ask Assistant to read supported PDF, Office, OpenDocument, RTF, EPUB, or CSV
  attachments. Assistant converts them to bounded untrusted text behind the same
  `read_file` tool; images remain a separate visual inspection.
- Give Assistant an exact public HTTPS file link to import that image, document,
  or raw repository file into the chat before inspecting it. Assistant cannot
  authenticate to private downloads or clone and browse a repository through
  that link.
- Ask for a PDF when the result should be downloadable. Assistant first writes
  or edits a Markdown file in the chat, converts it with an optional A4 print
  preset and custom CSS, then presents the generated PDF.
- Return to saved work through the 15 general chats in the sidebar, Project branches, search, or **See all** for the full chat list.
- Fork a useful point when another direction should not replace the existing
  conversation.
- Choose a model when the task needs a capability that the default model does
  not provide, and review requested actions before approving them.

Assistant can make mistakes. Check consequential facts, calculations, and
proposed actions before relying on them.

## Understand the Assistant model

| Resource or surface | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Chat | One user-owned conversation with a name and optional description |
| Message and turn | A request and the assistant run that answers it |
| Chat files | Source files and editable artifacts kept with one conversation |
| Personalization | User-scoped facts, preferences, and Cloud workflow defaults applied across conversations when enabled |
| Skills | Shared reusable workflows that each user can enable or disable for themselves |
| Remembered approvals | User-managed choices for bounded Actions that may run without asking each time |
| Project | Shared instructions, knowledge, files, references, and defaults used by private chats |

Project members with write access can manage shared instructions, knowledge,
files, and Cloud references directly from the Project context panel. Reference
search can be narrowed to one Cloud application. Project access remains an
administrator responsibility.

Project chats present that shared context together with chat sources and files,
but Project editing remains on the Project page. Instructions and knowledge
open as rendered Markdown, images open in the image viewer, and files open in
the file browser.

Readable Skills start enabled for each user. Open **Assistant settings → Skills**
to disable a Skill only for yourself or enable it again. This personal choice
does not change the Skill's Cloud access or availability for other users.

The empty chat keeps the composer in the center and offers editable starters
for common mail, scheduling, Cloud search, and planning work. Choosing a starter
fills the composer without sending it. Once the first request is sent, the
Project association is fixed and the composer moves below the conversation.

A model profile selects the provider model and available capabilities for a
turn. Assistant lists streaming, tool-capable models so stored chat and Project
images can be inspected again through `view_image`. Retry reruns a message in
the current branch. Fork copies the conversation through a selected message
into a new chat.

## How Assistant fits Cloud

Assistant owns its chat workspace and user experience. It uses Cloud's shared
AI runtime for conversations, model selection, streaming turns, files, Projects,
personalization, tool approvals, maintenance, and completion notifications. Cloud
identity keeps each personal workspace bound to a user.

Switching between chats, opening a Project chat, forking, and using browser
back or forward keep the workspace's live connection in place. Assistant
changes only which visible chat it follows. If the connection is interrupted,
it reloads authorized state and continues the current turn without relying on
missed live updates.

## Find detailed product help

Open **Help** inside Assistant for chats, message actions, files,
personalization, and guidance for better requests. Developers can read
[Chat runtime and streaming](/en/docs/ai/chat-runtime-and-streaming),
[Files, Projects, and personalization](/en/docs/ai/files-projects-and-personalization), and
[Tools and approvals](/en/docs/ai/tools-and-approvals) for the shared contracts
Assistant adopts.

Open **Assistant settings → Approvals** to review Actions previously accepted with
**Always approve**. Revoking an entry makes Assistant ask again on the next
matching call. Sending email, deleting data, open-world effects, and other
Actions not explicitly marked as rememberable continue to require confirmation
every time.

## Use Assistant from the terminal

Assistant provides one native CLI entry point for interactive work and
automation:

```bash
cld assistant
cld assistant "Start with this request"
cld assistant --chat <chat-id>
cld assistant -p "Print one response and exit"
```

Interactive mode streams replies into the terminal and keeps the same chat for
later prompts. Use `--print` or `-p` for scripts, pipelines, structured output,
or one request without a prompt loop. Its startup line shows the effective
model. A new chat prints its stable `cld assistant --chat <chat-id>` resume
command, and the CLI repeats that command when the session ends. Blue `Info:`
messages confirm non-error state changes such as attachments, model selection,
and stopped turns. Run `/model` without an argument to select an available
model by number. The model remains active for the session.

Use `cld assistant --allow-bash` when the Assistant must work on the computer
running the CLI. This exposes a local Bash tool only for that interactive
session. Every requested command is shown and requires a fresh `Y/n`
confirmation. Commands run with the current OS user's permissions in the CLI's
startup directory, and their bounded output is stored in the chat and sent to
the model. The web app can display these calls later but cannot run them.

The interactive CLI offers `a` for **Always approve** only when the pending
Capability Action supports remembered approval. Print mode never creates a
remembered approval, and local Bash always requires a fresh confirmation.

Start with these read-only checks before choosing a model or continuing a chat:

```bash
cld assistant status --json
cld assistant models --json
```

Run `cld assistant help` for chat flags and the management commands for chats,
messages, files, preferences, Projects, and turn actions. Run
`cld assistant <command> --help` before approving or changing stored state.
